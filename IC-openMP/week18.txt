TODO:
	Move from OpenMP to OmpSs
	Prepare environment and start porting
REPORT:
	Studied OmpSs.
	Compiling mercurium and nanos++ was not straightforward as thought.
	Created a docker image that contains the nanos++ runtime, mercurium, bench, gcc and everyone else.
	Added a new column to the output of the system, it has a sha256 of the output.
