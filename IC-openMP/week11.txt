REPORT
    Due to a hardware problem my laptop in under maintance, during this time I will utilize my iMAc Early 2011.
    Virtual machine created and working environment for MacOS also working.
    For MacOS, utilized gcc-8 from brew.

    Fixed a typo in the bench.c code that generated invalid JSON.

    Generated Statistics using crate Statistical -> mean, median, std_variance
    Genrated Hardware informantion using neofetch due to its hablity to ommit information

    Time unit is in seconds: t.tv_sec  + t.tv_nsec *1e-9;
    Precision up to n_sec;

    API overhead is little for number impact, produce a more detailed result later (Next Report maybe)

    Working on strassen:
        Strassen has someproblem with MacOS toolchain, wich make it fails with -c
        Atual progress: marking thread inside strassen-task
