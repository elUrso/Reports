TODO:
	Port the maxium number of benchmarks to the system
REPORT:
	Renamed OpenMP-Ports to taskdep-suit
	Added process_append_file to the api
	Ported Kastors {jacobi, sparselu, strassen}
	BOTS port delayed due to no use of task dependency
	
	Ported Parsec:
		backscholes: taskwait, spinlock with atomic will resolve the problem
		dedup: taskwait, may require a 'soft taskwait', no taskmeasure for the moment. Requires env var BENCH_SILENT
