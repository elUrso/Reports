REPORT
    Port Karstors:
        Need to analise how to access memory because accessing pointer generates seg fault -> ask Lucas.
    
    Major code refactor done, just need to find a solution for the segfault problem to add task measures
    
    Analyse race conditions or dereferenciations

    ----

    Studing the reason for the segfault in Kastors when mesuring a task size in ticks.

    Initiated BOTS porting, for some reason uts has segfault bug, so it will be left of for now.
    ksnapsack also will be left out for not offering OPENMP task implementations, later it may be converted.
