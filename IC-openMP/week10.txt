REPORT:
	
	Due to a problem with my phisical keyboard, I lost a lot of time trying to fix it.
	Looks like karma is not at my side this time.

	Alter task timing to clock instead of ms.
	Timing of tasks utilizes RDTSC instruction.

```{c}
unsigned long long clk_timing(void) {
	unsigned long lo, hi;
	unsigned long long l, h;
	asm("rdtsc" : "=a"(lo), "=d"(hi)); 
	h = hi;
	l = lo | (h << 32);
	return l;
}
```

	Testing performance under MinGW-w64 Windows (c) and MVSC Windows (rust) environment.

	>> Compare omp with measure vs omp without
	bench api bug fixed!
